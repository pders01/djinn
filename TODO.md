# djinn TODO

State as of May 4, 2026. **0.1.0-alpha.1 cut**: signed `.app` bundle,
GitHub Actions CI + release workflow, branded `.icns`, MIT LICENSE +
NOTICES, multi-profile sessions, theme inheritance for `light:X,dark:Y`
specs, dim-priority semantics for `state.json` vs config.

djinn is a libghostty-surface host. ghostty owns the visible
terminal area end-to-end (PTY, render, scrollback, selection,
hyperlink hover, search, IME). djinn keeps panel chrome, MCP server,
agent state surface, hotkey, menubar, log pane, drag-drop,
find-overlay UI, an action keymap, a SessionManager, and a
multi-profile tab strip + Cmd+Shift+P palette switcher on top.

NSResponder coverage is complete (right / middle / hover / focus /
modifier-only / Y-flip / scroll precision / keyUp / pressureChange).
Clipboard write/read flows through ghostty's callbacks; system
appearance flips push to ghostty + reload its config from disk.
Cmd+Tab focus restoration on macOS 14+ is fixed via
`setHidesOnDeactivate:` + dropping `setFloatingPanel:1`.

Profile scripts (`profile.<name>.script = path`) let users construct
the agentic shell with arbitrary bash; the script `exec`s the agent
at the end, and djinn validates existence + execute-bit at startup.

`just dev-cert` installs a stable self-signed codesign identity in
the user's login keychain so every `install-app` keeps TCC grants
across rebuilds. Local iteration no longer needs `tccutil reset`.

## Open work — pick from here

### Restart current session / drop to shell *(asked, not started)*

When the script-spawned child exits (Pi exits, agent crashes, user
runs `exit`), ghostty currently shows "Process exited. Press any key
to close the terminal." There's no in-app path to re-spawn the same
profile or fall back to a plain shell.

Sketch:
- `restart_session` action — frees `app.g.session_manager.active().surface`
  via `ghostty_surface_free`, then re-runs the spawn path against the
  same `Session.surface_host` NSView. Bind to `Cmd+R` by default.
- `shell_session` action — same path but overrides command to
  `/bin/zsh` for the current session. Bind to `Cmd+Shift+R`.
- Trickiest part: dispatching the re-spawn on the main queue after
  `surface_free` returns — ghostty's IO mailbox needs a runloop turn
  to unwind before a fresh surface binds to the same NSView.

### Per-profile env vars *(low priority — script subsumes)*

`profile.<name>.script` already lets users export env vars before
`exec`'ing the agent, so this is no longer blocking. Still nice to
have for declarative configs that don't want a shell layer:

```
profile.main.env.OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-...
```

Parse via `applyProfileKey` — when `field` starts with `env.`, append
to a `[]const struct { k: []const u8, v: []const u8 }` on the entry.
Spawn path: pass through to ghostty via `surface_config_s.env_*`
(`_count` + `_pairs` pattern in ghostty.h).

### Dynamic profile creation *(deferred — needs config writeback)*

Currently profiles are file-defined. A `Cmd+Shift+N → New profile`
overlay would let users add a profile at runtime, but persisting it
requires writing back to `~/.config/djinn/config` without clobbering
comments / formatting. Either:

1. Append `profile.<name>.*` lines to the bottom of the file (simplest,
   preserves comments above).
2. Build a structure-preserving editor — read line-by-line, find the
   profile section, insert in place.

Pick (1) for v1 if this lands. The palette-switcher UX from `ab9b18e`
is the natural place to surface a "+ New profile…" affordance.

### Lower-priority NSResponder gaps *(audit residue)*

- `magnify:` — pinch-to-zoom font size. ghostty.app itself doesn't
  override this; would need a host-side accumulator over
  `event.magnification` deltas. Skip until users ask.
- `quickLook:` — three-finger-tap dictionary lookup over the
  selection. Needs CTFont attribute dict + NSAttributedString
  presentation. Mirror ghostty.app's `quickLook(with:)`
  (SurfaceView_AppKit.swift:1438) if this lands.

### Per-call log expansion *(deferred — speculative)*

Tool calls collapse to a one-line summary, click expands to args +
result. Today's `djinn_log` carries only `message` + `level`; nothing
structured to expand. Path:

1. New MCP tool (`djinn_tool_call` with `tool_name` / `args` / `result`)
   or extend `djinn_log` with optional structured payload.
2. Extend `LogEntry` (`state.zig`) with `kind: enum { simple,
   tool_call }`.
3. log_view: per-entry NSView (instead of one shared NSTextStorage)
   so each row carries its own click handler + collapse state.

Step 3 is expensive. Worth it only if MCP side actually grows
tool-call telemetry.

### Animated log row insertion *(deferred — bad cost/value)*

CALayer fade-in on new rows. Conflicts with scroll-to-end (animation
+ autoscroll fight) and depends on the per-row NSView refactor
above. Revisit only if per-call expansion lands.

### Sleep / wake verification *(manual)*

Surface child behavior post-system-sleep is untested. Should be
ghostty's problem (we don't own the PTY or render pump), but worth
opening the panel after a sleep cycle. No automation path.

### TCC for distribution *(blocked on Developer ID signing)*

Local iteration is fixed via `just dev-cert`. For *redistribution*
(handing the bundle to another user), they'd hit the same cdhash
churn on each new release: TCC matches on certificate leaf hash, not
on the act of signing. Real fix for shipping: Developer ID
certificate + notarytool flow in `release.yml`. Needs paid Apple
Developer account ($99/yr) — out of scope for the alpha.

### Pure-nix package build *(blocked on Metal Toolchain access)*

`packages.default` attempted but the nix builder can't reach the
Metal Toolchain (Apple ships it through cryptexd at
`/var/run/com.apple.security.cryptexd/...`, invisible to the build
sandbox even with `__noChroot = true`). Workaround: `apps.*` runners
delegate to host-side `zig build`. Real fix: ghostty ships pre-built
`.metallib` OR nixpkgs adopts the Metal Toolchain as a fetched dep.

### Dispatch table coverage *(decision logged)*

~50 ghostty action handlers stubbed (`stub("…")` returning false).
Mostly window-manager actions (new_window, new_tab, toggle_fullscreen)
that don't apply to a Quake-drop panel. **Skip** — listed so nobody
re-litigates.

## Recently shipped — current session

### Cmd+Tab focus restoration
- **`setHidesOnDeactivate:` for blur-hide** — replaces the
  cross-app-activate dance that fought macOS 14+'s throttle. djinn
  deactivates as a *consequence* of the user's target activating, so
  no cascade fires.
- **Drop `setFloatingPanel:1`** — floating panels keep app key state
  across cross-window focus shifts (tool-palette idiom), which
  prevented `windowDidResignKey` from firing on Cmd+Tab.
- **`Panel.hide` skips prev-app restore when user navigated away** —
  guard via `NSApp.isActive` (not `NSWorkspace.frontmostApplication`,
  which never reports an Accessory app as frontmost).

### Profile scripts
- **`profile.<name>.script`** points at an executable shell script;
  djinn passes the path to ghostty as the PTY command. Script must
  `exec` the agent at the end.
- Spawn precedence: `script > command > provider shortcut > /bin/zsh`.
- `SessionManager.resolveScript` expands `~/`, validates existence +
  execute bit; on failure logs a warning and falls through to the
  next layer.

### Chrome polish
- **Single border tone**: `chip.border = mix(bg, black, 0.2)`.
  Tracks ghostty's split-divider tone (sampled #151824 against
  #1a1b26 bg). All four host surfaces (find chip, log pane, tab
  strip, palette) use this token.
- **Chrome typography**: `chrome.chromeFont` returns the system UI
  font (San Francisco, medium weight). Caps at 13pt for log entries,
  12pt for chips so chrome stays subordinate to terminal output
  regardless of theme font size.
- **Layout chrome = surface bg, overlay chrome = chip bg**: tab strip
  + log pane fill `style.bg` (no seam against terminal column);
  find chip + palette switcher fill `chip.bg` (lifted, with 1px
  chip.border outline).
- **Per-group hairline divider in the log pane** (`─` × N) above
  each new-client header. Single-client streams stay clean.
- **Tab labels left-aligned** with 12pt inset — stable horizontal
  position across active/inactive font swaps.
- **Divider between terminal + log pane is now a transparent
  hit-target** — the prior white@5% fill produced a dark fringe
  next to the log pane's chip.border separator on translucent
  panels.

### Stable codesign identity
- **`scripts/dev-cert-create.sh`** generates a self-signed cert in
  login.keychain. OpenSSL `-legacy -macalg SHA1` PKCS12 (modern
  AES-256/SHA-256 fails macOS's `security import`).
- **`scripts/codesign-bundle.sh`** probes via `find-certificate`
  (`find-identity -v` filters self-signed even though codesign
  accepts them); falls back to ad-hoc on failure.
- `just dev-cert` recipe + README "Stable signing identity" section.
- TCC grants now persist across rebuilds — designated requirement
  stays constant (`identifier "..." and certificate leaf = H"..."`).

### CI fixes
- **`mlugg/setup-zig` v1 → v2** — v1 line ended at 1.2.2 and didn't
  recognise the newer Zig mirror tarball naming, breaking installs
  with cascading 503/404s.
- **Pin newest Xcode + probe `xcrun --find metal`** — runner's default
  `xcode-select` may point at an Xcode <15.3 that rejects
  `-downloadComponent`. Switch to `/Applications/Xcode_*.app | sort
  -V | tail -1` first, then probe; fallback to `-downloadComponent`
  works against the newer Xcode if the toolchain is genuinely
  missing.
- **`bundle` job** added to ci.yml — full distributable path
  (Metal compile, install_name_tool rpath, ad-hoc codesign,
  `--version` smoke) runs on every push, not just on tags.

### Bug fixes from review
- **`Panel.hide` Accessory-app guard** — see above.
- **NSObject leaks in chrome paint loops** — `appendStyled` (log
  pane) + `appendFindRun` / `updateSearchCountLabel` (find chip)
  allocated `NSMutableParagraphStyle` and `NSAttributedString`
  without `release`. Hot-path leak under streaming logs / find
  typing. Paired `defer release` after consumer takes its retain.
- **`resolveScript` double-free** — function-scope `errdefer
  allocator.free(expanded)` fired on later error AFTER `owned`
  already retained the pointer; outer init errdefer drained `owned`
  → double-free. Replaced with explicit `catch |e| { free; return
  e; }` at ownership-transfer point.
- **`codesign-bundle.sh` swallowed errors** — stderr was redirected
  to `/dev/null`, so failed signed-path runs silently fell to ad-hoc
  with no diagnostic. TCC stability goal silently unmet. Stderr now
  surfaces.

## Ghostty dependency boundary

djinn links the **full libghostty** (surface API).
`patches/ghostty-001-darwin-install.patch` +
`scripts/apply-ghostty-patch.sh` make `dep.artifact("ghostty")`
resolve on macOS; `scripts/build.sh` applies the patch and unsets
nix's Apple SDK env vars.

The `wakeup_cb` (`acd7280`) wires `ghostty_app_tick` on the main
queue — without it ghostty's IO mailbox events stall (child_exited,
OSC actions, render hints never fire).

## Style / code-health (kept current)

- Zig 0.15 quirks: `memory/djinn_zig_015_pitfalls.md`.
- Single `@cImport` per C header — Zig duplicates opaque types
  across modules. AppState uses `?*anyopaque` slots for
  `ghostty_surface` + `ghostty_config` to keep ghostty.h's cImport
  out of `app.zig` + `theme.zig`.
- `dispatch_object_t` is a transparent union — declare via
  `?*anyopaque` extern.
- NSSound is main-thread-only — afplay subprocess for non-main
  callers.
- `ghostty_config_get` `@alignCast`s caller's pointer to the source
  field's type. Passing the wrong-size slot writes only the lower
  bytes (f64 for f32 → upper half zero) OR panics on alignment
  (f32 for f64). **Use `configF32` for f32 fields, `configF64` for
  f64; `configColor` / `configPalette` for structs.**
- **Action callbacks fire synchronously inside
  `performBindingAction`.** Handlers must not re-emit the binding
  they're handling — recurse to stack overflow.
- **Borderless NSPanel + NSTextField + ghostty surface** doesn't
  compose into a working field editor. Use host-owned input via
  keyDownImpl + a host buffer instead. Find overlay + palette
  switcher both use this idiom.
- **CALayer-backed views with custom layouts** don't reliably honor
  `setHidden` for visibility toggling when ghostty's CAMetalLayer
  drives its own CADisplayLink. Use frame-to-zero for full hide;
  setHidden works for the surface_host swap (no layout recompute).
- **Stash key NSView pointers on AppState** instead of indexing
  `container.subviews[idx]`. Slots: `surface_host_id`,
  `divider_view_id`, `search_field_id`, `tab_strip_id`,
  `tab_strip_separator_id`, `palette_view_id`. Per-session
  surface_host pointers live on `Session.surface_host`
  (`?*anyopaque`).
- **NSTextFieldCell does not vertically center.** Subclass + override
  `drawInteriorWithFrame:inView:` (see `DjinnChipCell` in view.zig).
- **`acceptsFirstMouse:` YES on borderless-panel drag controls.**
  Without it the first click goes to window-activation hit-test and
  the drag never starts (`DjinnDivider`).
- **`std.os.linux.*` is wrong on darwin.** Compiles but returns
  junk for syscall wrappers. Use `std.posix` or `std.c`.
- **`Config.load` propagates errors.** Don't swallow open / read
  failures as a default `Config{}` — atomic-write rename gaps blip
  the file briefly, and the silent-default substitution clobbers
  every running setting.
- **State.json complements config dims**, doesn't override. Optional
  fields on `WindowConfig` track "user pinned this explicitly" vs
  "fall through to state.json or default."
- **ghostty's `theme = light:X,dark:Y` resolution** uses
  `_conditional_state` inside ghostty. No public C API to set it
  pre-finalize, so djinn peeks the user's ghostty config + writes
  a tmp `theme = <variant>` loaded before finalize to override.
  **Both `App.init` and `reloadConfigFromDisk` apply this** —
  diverging breaks dual-theme users on every config save.
- **Provider shortcut match is case-insensitive.** Config values are
  user-typed (`provider = Claude` works); config KEYS are still
  strict-lowercase.
- **NSResponder method coverage matters.** Each missing override on
  TerminalView = one silently-dropped terminal feature (right-click
  in tmux, Cmd-hover hyperlinks, focus reports, etc.). Audit
  against ghostty.app's `SurfaceView_AppKit.swift` when adding new
  input paths.
- **Mouse Y is bottom-up in NSView, top-down in ghostty.** Convert
  at the boundary via `frame.size.height - local.y`. Same fix
  pattern as `firstRectForCharacterRange:`.
- **`ghostty_input_scroll_mods_t` is a packed byte.** ghostty.h
  calls it `int` because C can't express the layout; bit 0 =
  precision, bits 1-3 = momentum enum. Passing 0 means "non-precise
  scroll, no momentum" → trackpad pixel deltas treated as line
  counts.
- **Idempotency comments are review fuel.** When a comment promises
  "registers on first call only" but the code unconditionally
  registers, the bug stays latent until something triggers the path
  more than once.
- **Accessory app + `NSWorkspace.frontmostApplication`** never
  reports djinn itself as frontmost — workspace tracks regular
  apps only. Use `NSApp.isActive` for "is djinn the active app"
  questions; use `NSWorkspace.frontmostApplication` only for
  "which OTHER app owns the menu bar".
- **`setFloatingPanel:1`** keeps the app's key window across
  cross-window focus shifts (tool-palette idiom). Fatal for
  Quake-drop UX: `windowDidResignKey` never fires on Cmd+Tab,
  so blur-driven hide never engages. Use `setLevel:` +
  collection behavior alone for visual on-top.
- **`setHidesOnDeactivate:`** is the right blur-hide knob on
  Accessory apps. It sidesteps the macOS 14+ cross-app activation
  throttle entirely — the user's target activates, djinn
  deactivates as a consequence, panel auto-hides. No cascade.
- **alloc/init from Zig is +1 retained**, period. There's no ARC
  bridging; every `alloc/init` needs a `release`. `defer
  obj.msgSend(void, "release", .{})` after the consumer takes
  its +1 retain is the idiomatic balance. Class factory methods
  (`stringWith…:`, `dictionaryWith…:`) return autoreleased
  objects and don't need an explicit release.
- **errdefer at function scope keeps firing for the whole
  function body.** Once ownership transfers (e.g. to an
  ArrayList), the errdefer becomes harmful — a later error in
  the same function fires the errdefer AND the caller's drain
  of the list → double-free. Use explicit `catch |e| { free;
  return e; }` at the ownership-transfer site instead of relying
  on errdefer past it.
- **Chrome design vocabulary**: layout chrome (tab strip, log
  pane, terminal column) shares `style.bg` — single continuous
  surface, only chrome cue is a 1px chip.border at the seam.
  Overlay chrome (find chip, palette switcher) uses
  `style.chip.bg` (lifted) + 1px chip.border outline + 4px
  corner radius — floats above the surface deliberately.
- **Border tone is theme-derived, not hardcoded**:
  `chip.border = mix(bg, black, 0.2)`. Tracks ghostty's
  split-divider hairline tone across all themes; pure-black mix
  is the only theme-invariant way to "go darker than bg by N%".
